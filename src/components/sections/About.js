      <h3>About Me </h3>
      <p>
        Technology amazes me! I have been fascinated with coding and web
        development for many many years. I have a B.S. in Web Development and
        Design, graduated from Full Sail University in 2014. I am passionate
        about learning and I am always actively trying to learn something new.
        Currently, it is my mission to learn GOLang.

        Javascript was the first language I learned, aside from HTML/CSS. The
        first snippet of code I wrote was an automation for Photoshop. After I
        saw how much easier it made my work, I was hooked.
      </p>
      <p>
        Technology has the ability to improve our lives in so many ways. I am
        determined be a part of that world changing revolution.
